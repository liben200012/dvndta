# DVNDTA: A Dual Virtual Node Based Heterogeneous Interaction Model for Accurate Prediction of Drug-Target Affinity
DVNDTA is a deep learning model for predicting drug target affinity, which can predict the corresponding affinity by using the pre processed complex as input.
## Data
You can <http://www.pdbbind.org.cn/download.php> download the required data.
## usage
- Firstly, use preprocessing.py to perform preliminary preprocessing on the data.
- Create a graph for input using dataset_DVNDTA.py
- Train the model using train_devndta.py.
